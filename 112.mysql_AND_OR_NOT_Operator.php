<!-- In My , the AND, OR, and NOT operators are used to combine conditions in the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement. These operators allow you to create complex conditions by specifying multiple criteria. Here's the syntax for using these operators: -->
<!-- 
1. AND Operator (&& or AND):

The AND operator combines two or more conditions and returns true only if all the conditions are true.

Syntax: -->

 
<!--  
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND ...;
Example: 

SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND price < 500;
In this example, the query retrieves products that belong to the "Electronics" category and have a price less than 500. -->




<!-- 2. OR Operator (|| or OR):

The OR operator combines two or more conditions and returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.
Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR ...;
Example:


SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics' OR category = 'Appliances';
In this example, the query retrieves products that belong to either the "Electronics" or "Appliances" category.
 -->


<!-- 3. NOT Operator (NOT):

The NOT operator negates a condition and returns true if the condition is false, and false if the condition is true.

Syntax:
 
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
Example:

SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE NOT category = 'Clothing';
In this example, the query retrieves products that do not belong to the "Clothing" category. -->

<!-- You can use parentheses to group conditions and control the order of evaluation when combining multiple conditions. This allows you to create more complex logical expressions. For example:

 
 
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE (condition1 AND condition2) OR (condition3 AND NOT condition4);
In this query, conditions 1 and 2 must both be true, or conditions 3 must be true while condition 4 is false for a row to be selected. -->
